### Project Description
[A volume slider that does not actually decrease or increase anything cause there's nothing playing in the background. Once the slider passes 100, it falls off the slider and a message pops up saying "Sanity lost!" and the slider breaks down into pieces where then the user has to place those pieces in the right order for the slider to be functioning again!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Sliders-once symbols of control and stability,are now abused- recklessly dragged beyond their limits.No one asks what happens after 100.No one cares when the slider cries.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

### Project Description
[A volume slider that does not actually decrease or increase anything cause there's nothing playing in the background. Once the slider passes 100, it falls off the slider and sadly you'll have to pick it up and place it back on the slider or else the volume gets into a "complex" situation!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Sliders-once symbols of control and stability,are now abused- recklessly dragged beyond their limits.No one asks what happens after 100.No one cares when the slider cries.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We gave the slider emotions ‚Äî because sliders have feelings too. Past 100, it doesn‚Äôt just get louder; it starts questioning its existence. So it rolls, falls, bounces, and breaks free‚Ä¶ until society (the sine wave) pulls it back.]
